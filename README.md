[RPSLS Game](https://kurkrogi.github.io/RPSLS-game/) allows user to play Rock-Paper-Scisors-Lizard-Spock game agains 3 different opponents. Each of them employs different strategy to win. Mr Spock analyses previous player throws and plays against the most frequent one, Dr. Sheldon always throws "Spock", and Prof. Randomius plays a random throw. The source of random numbers is [Random.org](https://www.random.org/) and only if their API is unavailable a random number is generated by the game script.
